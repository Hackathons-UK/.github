# We are Hackathons UK

We're a growing, community-led non-profit focused on supporting hackathon organisers and student tech societies in the United Kingdom. Hackathons UK represents the tightly knit community of hackathon organisers in the UK. A dynamic, inclusive and ever-changing community, we focus on providing knowledge and resources to hackathon organisers at universities and further afield. Having been there ourselves, we know how challenging it can be to put these events together!

We're a young but growing organisation rapidly developing the hackathon space. We're led by the community and driven to share our knowledge and experience of organising hackathons with new organisers to best support events and mitigate inevitable knowledge loss due to the fast-changing nature of student-led organisations. Hackathons are great for so many reasons. These weekend-long invention marathons provide so many professional and personal development opportunities for everybody who's involved in them.
